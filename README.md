# Glass-aware-SLAM-project
 This repository contains the implementation of a glass-aware SLAM system designed for indoor mobile robots. The system integrates 2D LiDAR-based SLAM (using slam_toolbox) with real-time glass detection from RGB and stereo depth data using an OAK-D Pro camera and a custom YOLOv8 model.
